# SQUAREM
This is a small exercise to demonstrate the use of SQUAREM, which enhances the convergence of contraction mapping. The example is naive by itself. But the technique can be applied to BLP contraction mapping for the inner-loop. I applies the algorithm to BLP demand estimation in my paper too.
